# NUDZ_gamble

PWA for harm reduction in gambling — DigiWELL Hackathon 2026.

> **Status: technology bootstrap plus coping-strategies vertical slice.** The coping
> onboarding, personal strategy plan, persistence and responsive navigation are
> implemented. The remaining intervention flows are still planned work.

### Why TypeScript 6

TypeScript 7 (the native Go port) is the current `latest`, but `typescript-eslint` still
declares `typescript@>=4.8.4 <6.1.0` as a peer — type-aware linting does not work on TS 7
yet. The project is therefore pinned to `typescript@~6.0.3`, which is the newest release
the linter supports. Note TS 6 deprecates `baseUrl`, so `paths` in `tsconfig.app.json` are
written relative to the config file (`./src/*`).

## Getting started

Requires **Node ≥ 20.19** (Vite 8 needs it; older Node fails on startup with a
`styleText` import error from `node:util`).

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install    # once, downloads the e2e browsers
npm run dev               # http://localhost:5173 (also served on the LAN IP)
```

## Scripts

| Script                  | What it does                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`           | Vite dev server, PWA enabled                                |
| `npm run build`         | `tsc -b` then production build + service worker             |
| `npm run preview`       | Serve the production build locally                          |
| `npm run typecheck`     | Typechecks the app, the Jest project and the e2e project    |
| `npm run lint`          | ESLint (type-aware); `lint:fix` to autofix                  |
| `npm run format`        | Prettier write; `format:check` to verify                    |
| `npm run test`          | Jest — `tests/jest/**/*.test.ts(x)`                          |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Jest with coverage over `src/domain` and `src/data`          |
| `npm run test:e2e`      | Playwright — `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts`                        |
| `npm run test:all`      | Unit + e2e tests                                            |
| `npm run check`         | typecheck + lint + format:check + Jest (CI gate)            |

## Coping strategies prototype

The branch `codex/coping-strategies-v1` contains the first end-to-end coping
plan slice: onboarding defaults, user-authored strategies, IndexedDB
persistence, a dedicated responsive navigation destination and research-backed
product rationale. Start with [the v1 product specification](docs/coping-strategies-v1.md)
and [the expanded domain model](src/data/docs/domain-model.md).

The implementation intentionally positions coping as a self-management aid,
not treatment. At least one strategy must remain active; catalog copy is keyed
by stable IDs and custom copy is stored separately.

## Layout

```
src/
  ui/        layer A — presentation (React)
  domain/    layer B — intervention logic (pure; empty for now)
  data/      layer C — persistence (Dexie/IndexedDB)
tests/
  jest/      unit tests (own tsconfig + setup), mirror the src/ structure
  e2e/       Playwright specs (own tsconfig)
public/      icons, favicon
```

Path aliases `@/`, `@ui/`, `@domain/`, `@data/` are configured in `tsconfig.app.json`,
`vite.config.ts` and `jest.config.ts` (Jest does not read Vite's resolver, so the mapping
is restated there).

### Layer boundary is enforced by the linter

`eslint.config.js` adds a `no-restricted-imports` rule that forbids `src/domain/**` from
importing `react`, `dexie`, `zustand`, `@ui/*` or `@data/*`. The intervention logic stays pure and
storage-agnostic, so swapping IndexedDB for a server later does not mean rewriting it.

### Unit tests

Jest is the only unit-test runner. Tests live in `tests/jest/**` (mirroring `src/`), not
next to the sources — `tests/jest/tsconfig.json` is the only tsconfig that pulls in
`@types/jest`, so the app tsconfig stays free of test globals. IndexedDB is provided by
`fake-indexeddb` in the Jest setup file.

## Dependency licenses

The project is released under MIT (`LICENSE`). All direct dependencies are permissive and
MIT-compatible; there is no GPL/LGPL/AGPL or share-alike code in the tree.

- **Apache-2.0** — `typescript`, `dexie`, `fake-indexeddb`, `@playwright/test`
- **MIT** — everything else: `react`, `react-dom`, `zustand`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`,
  `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `vite-plugin-pwa`, `eslint`, `@eslint/js`,
  `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`,
  `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`, `globals`, `prettier`, `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`,
  `@testing-library/react`, `jest`, `ts-jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`, and the
  `@types/*` packages (DefinitelyTyped)

Icons in `public/` are generated for this repository and carry no third-party license.

## Known gaps

- Limits, check-in and review domain logic are not implemented yet.
- IndexedDB currently models coping strategies; the remaining entities still need stores.
- CSV export, seed/demo mode and the reminder scenario required by the brief are not built.
- The caution/exceeded reminder still needs to consume the selected coping plan.

## Tooling disclosure

Project bootstrap was generated with the assistance of Claude (Anthropic).
