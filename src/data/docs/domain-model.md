# 01 — Domain Model

Field names below are copied verbatim from the brief. Don't rename them —
the jury will look for them by name, and the export spec (doc 12) depends on
these exact names.

## profile (one record per user)

Single local user profile and intervention setup.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| user_id | string | e.g. `A001` in seed data |
| onboarding_completed_at | timestamp | ISO 8601 with timezone |
| intervention_start_date | date | = day after onboarding completed |
| reference_time_min | int minutes | weekly reference |
| reference_stakes_czk | int CZK | weekly reference |

Storage key: `user_id`

## coping_strategy (many records per user)

The user's coping plan. Catalog strategies are stored by stable semantic ID;
custom strategies keep user-authored copy. A row can exist without being
selected, so changing the plan does not destroy history or conflate catalog
availability with the user's current choice.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| coping_strategy_id | string | `catalog:<catalog_strategy_id>` or `custom:<UUID>` |
| user_id | string | links to `profile.user_id` |
| source | `catalog` \| `custom` | provenance; never inferred from the title |
| catalog_strategy_id | enum, nullable | stable copy-independent catalog key |
| custom_title | string, nullable | required for `custom`, max 80 characters |
| custom_note | string, nullable | optional implementation cue, max 240 characters |
| is_selected | 0 \| 1 | part of the user's current reminder plan |
| sort_order | non-negative int | stable display order |
| created_at | timestamp | ISO 8601 with timezone |
| updated_at | timestamp | ISO 8601 with timezone |
| archived_at | timestamp, nullable | soft delete for a custom strategy |

Storage key: `coping_strategy_id`

## limit (one record per user per week, append-only — never overwritten)

Weekly gambling limits.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| limit_id | string | UUID/local stable id |
| user_id | string | links to `profile.user_id` |
| week_no | 1..4 | |
| weekly_limit_time_min | int | ≤ 90% of reference_time_min |
| weekly_limit_stakes_czk | int | ≤ 90% of reference_stakes_czk |
| limit_set_at | timestamp | |

Unique key: `user_id + week_no`

## check-in (one record per user per reported day)

Daily gambling behavior record.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| check_in_id | string | UUID/local stable id |
| user_id | string | links to `profile.user_id` |
| behavior_date | date | the day the data describes |
| played | bool | |
| submitted_at | timestamp | when actually sent |
| updated_at | timestamp | last edit, nullable |
| time_min | int | 0 when played=false |
| stakes_czk | int | 0 when played=false |
| winnings_czk | int | recorded, never affects limit status |

Unique key: `user_id + behavior_date`

## review (one per user per closed week)

Weekly review completion state.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| review_id | string | UUID/local stable id |
| user_id | string | links to `profile.user_id` |
| review_week_no | 1..4 | |
| review_completed_at | timestamp | |
| limit_changed | bool | |
| incomplete | bool | true if closed with missing check-ins |

Unique key: `user_id + review_week_no`

## Dexie store draft

```txt
profile: "user_id"
coping_strategies: "coping_strategy_id, user_id, source, catalog_strategy_id, updated_at, archived_at"
limits: "limit_id, [user_id+week_no], user_id, week_no, limit_set_at"
check_ins: "check_in_id, [user_id+behavior_date], user_id, behavior_date, submitted_at, updated_at, played"
reviews: "review_id, [user_id+review_week_no], user_id, review_week_no, review_completed_at, incomplete"
```

## What's explicitly NOT stored — compute on read, every time
Running consumption, net loss, weekly totals, overall status, `is_backfill`.
The brief is explicit that these come from the source records plus limit
history. Storing any of them is a scoring risk, not a shortcut — it's the
kind of thing a technical jury checks by editing seed data and reloading.

`is_backfill` is one comparison: calendar date of `submitted_at` >
`behavior_date` + 1 day.

## Invariants — assert these, don't just hope for them
1. `played == false` ⟹ `time_min == 0 && stakes_czk == 0`
2. At most one check-in per `user_id + behavior_date` — unique key
3. `weekly_limit_* ≤ 0.90 × reference_*`, for every week, always
4. Exactly one `limit` record per `user_id + week_no`; earlier ones never mutate
5. `winnings_czk` never enters a limit calculation, anywhere
6. No record for a day ≠ a zero record for that day. Two distinct states,
   never conflate them.
7. At least one active coping strategy has `is_selected == 1` after onboarding.
8. `source == catalog` ⟹ catalog ID present and custom fields null.
9. `source == custom` ⟹ custom title present and catalog ID null.
10. Archived strategies are never selected or shown in the active plan.

## Patterns worth using
- Value objects for `Minutes` and `Czk`. Both are plain integers, which is
  exactly how you end up silently comparing minutes to crowns somewhere —
  wrapping them stops the compiler (or at minimum, code review) from letting
  that through.
- Aggregate root: treat `profile + limits + checkins + reviews` as one
  aggregate for the single demo user. Makes local saving transactional for
  free — one blob, one write, no partial state.
- Repository per entity, or one repository for the whole aggregate. Given
  one user, one aggregate repository is simpler and just as correct.
- Immutable records: an edit produces a new object with a new `updated_at`,
  not a mutation in place.

## Type discipline
Money and time: integers, always. Percentages are the only place a float
belongs, and they're computed at evaluation/display time — never persisted.
Round for display only; classify status on the raw ratio, or you'll get a
79.6% that displays as "80%" while classifying as OK, and that inconsistency
is exactly the kind of thing that gets noticed on stage.

## Open questions
- Can the reference week be edited after onboarding? Not addressed. Default
  to no, note it as a known limitation in the README.
